        "We teach coding to elementary, middle and high school students so this universal language becomes second nature. We believe that learning how to code is like learning a foreign language, and the earlier students begin learning this new way of thinking, the easier it becomes. However, there is a fundamental disconnect between what students are learning in school and what is happening in the real world.",
        "Whilst growing up through the US education system, founder Kiera Peltz witnessed this disconnect personally. Disappointed in the level of computer science education offered to K-12 students, Kiera researched how other countries were educating their children. She felt the American system was not preparing students for a future where computer language will be the universal language for education, work and play. She sought a way to fix this gap; founding The Coding School in 2014."
