Disappointed in the level of computer science education offered to K-12 students, Kiera researched how other countries were educating their children.

She sought a way to fix this gap; founding The Coding School in 2014."

She is a graduate of Brown University, where she received her B.A. in Political Science and Happiness. In Summer 2014, Kiera began learning how to code at the White House as the Innovation & Technology intern in the Office of Presidential Correspondence. Having spent the majority of her free time in high school and college working in political offices, such as U.S. Congressman Brad Sherman and U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, Kiera is passionate about making computer science education a priority for politicians at the local, state, and federal level. \nKiera founded The Coding School after she realized the U.S. education system was failing to provide students with the skills needed to tackle the most pressing issues facing society. During her freshman year at Brown University, she was dissuaded from taking any computer science classes because she lacked prior coding knowledge. The following summer, while attending an international conference in Seliger, Russia, she met a group of Estonians, who spoke about the importance of early childhood coding, stating that it’s mandatory for every Estonian, starting at age seven, to learn how to code. Upon returning to the United States, Kiera began critically examining the education system and came to realize that while the world has changed drastically in the past 50 years, our country’s public K-12 curriculum has remained relatively unaltered. So she set out to fix the gap in the education system by creating The Coding School to ensure the next generation learns the language that has built – and will continue to build – the modern world. "
