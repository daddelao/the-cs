        title: "Our Footprint",
        paragraphs: [
          "By offering ongoing coding education, students develop the computational and critical thinking skills necessary to succeed in an increasingly tech-driven world. They become creators, innovators, and problem solvers, which translates to improvements in academic performance and postsecondary readiness. Moreover, these readily transferrable and highly sought after skills increase the opportunities for social mobility by expanding students’ employment options and prepare them for the 21st century workplace.",
          "In the long term, our dynamic coding initiatives will help address two of the main problems in the field of computer science: a shortage of coders and a lack of diversity.",
          "With regard to a shortage of coders, research shows that early exposure to computer science increases the chances students will pursue careers in computer programming. By providing classes as early as elementary school and continuing through high school, we are exposing students early on to coding, increasing their awareness of the variety of opportunities in the field, and most importantly, breaking down potential barriers that discourage students later on from learning coding by teaching this way of thinking early on.",
          "While our programs will increase the overall pool of computer scientists, our initiatives will also increase the diversity of computer scientists, overcoming a much larger and more difficult challenge. By offering coding classes specifically for underrepresented groups and communities, personalizing the educational experience to ensure traditional barriers to entry are eliminated, and providing long-term mentorship with individuals from similar backgrounds, we are helping foster confidence and empowerment in groups who are typically underrepresented – including minorities, females, students from low socioeconomic backgrounds and rural communities, and students with learning disabilities. By addressing systemic issues in the diversity pipeline through early education initiatives, this process sets the groundwork to significantly increase the number of diverse individuals entering the field who otherwise would be discouraged or not be likely to pursue this career path."

            "We offer a 3-year curriculum to ensure students truly learn the foundational basis of coding. Furthermore, we teach our students real coding languages from day one so they are learning how to code from the beginning."

            "Our teaching staff is comprised of 120 passionate computer science students, ranging from undergraduates to PhD students at USC, UCLA, Cal Tech, Cal State – Northridge, and Cal State – Sacramento. Our teachers match our students in race, gender, and socioeconomic backgrounds, and with their experiences at some of the most important start-ups and tech companies, from Google to SpaceX, they bring not only significant knowledge about computer programming but also engage the students in a peer-to-peer fashion."
