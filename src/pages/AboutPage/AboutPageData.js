        "The Coding School is a 501c3 organization that aims to empower the next generation through computer science education. Recognizing coding as the universal language of the 21st century, we believe coding education must be dynamic as we are not just training the next generation of coders but future leaders and problem solvers who will become CEOs, politicians, artists and scientific innovators. Thus, we are pushing the boundaries of traditional coding education, embracing a diverse set of approaches and programs to ensure all students, regardless of socioeconomic background, geographic location, or learning differences, develop the skills necessary to thrive and tackle the most pressing issues facing our world.",
        "Founded by a Brown undergrad in 2014, The Coding School consists of a teaching team of 120 computer science and engineering students from six universities in California who are passionate about teaching the next generation the power of computer science. Through afterschool classes, we have taught over 2,500 K-8 students how to code at 16 schools in Los Angeles and Sacramento."
